# OAuth 2.0 Server for Laravel

This is a fork of the abandoned [lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel](https://github.com/lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel) package. It has been upgraded by [Shift](https://laravelshift.com/) to be minimally compatible with Laravel 9. 

**It is untested** and **not recommended for use**. Instead, you should migrate to [Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/passport) or [Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/sanctum).
